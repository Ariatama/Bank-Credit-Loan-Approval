#**📂 Bank Credit Loan Approval**
This project aims to develop a predictive system for bank loan approval using Machine Learning and Ensemble Learning approaches. By analyzing historical applicant data, the system helps banks evaluate credit eligibility more efficiently, quickly, and accurately.

##**🔍 Key Features**
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distribution and correlation
- Implementation of various classification models to predict loan approval status

##**🤖 Machine Learning Models**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

##**🧠 Ensemble Learning Models**
- Random Forest
- Voting Classifier
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- AdaBoost
- Stacking Classifier

##**📊 Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve
- K-Fold Cross Validation for robust performance assessment

##**🗂️ Dataset**
